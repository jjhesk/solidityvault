# StrategyYfiiPool2

接受bpt来挖 yfii

yvault内置了 dai2bpt, bpt2dai 来方便转换

 A strategy must implement the following calls;
 
 - deposit()
 - withdraw(address) must exclude any tokens used in the yield - Controller role - withdraw should return to Controller
 - withdraw(uint) - Controller | Vault role - withdraw should always return to vault
 - withdrawAll() - Controller | Vault role - withdraw should always return to vault
 - balanceOf()
 
 Where possible, strategies must remain as immutable as possible, instead of updating variables, we update the contract by linking it in the controller
